A high-performance SSH-based tunneling server designed for secure internet access, built with advanced security features and traffic monitoring capabilities.

**üìñ [ŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥€å](README.fa.md) | [English](README.md)**

## üöÄ Features

### üîí Security Features
- **Built-in Brute Force Protection**: Automatic IP blocking after failed authentication attempts

- **Blocking Unauthorized IPs**: Blocks IP addresses that you do not want the user to visit.
- **Tracking Visited Websites**: The ability to track the websites visited by the user, a feature you can enable or disable

### üåê Network Capabilities
- **Multi-port Support**: Run server on multiple ports simultaneously
- **TCP Forwarding**: Direct TCP connection forwarding without additional configuration
- **UDP Forwarding**: Full UDP traffic forwarding support

- **Dynamic Connection Handling**: When the session limit is reached, new connections can be rejected or queued ‚Äî fully configurable.
- **Real-time Session Monitoring**: Tracks and logs all active sessions in real time for auditing and analytics.


## üìã Requirements

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Configuration Files

#### `server_config.json`

  "shell": "cmd.exe",
  "max_auth_attempts": 3,
  "server_version": "SSH-2.0-Abdal-4iProto-Server"
}
```
#### linux 

```json
{
  "ports": [64235, 64236,64237],
  "shell": "/bin/bash",
  "max_auth_attempts": 3,
  "server_version": "SSH-2.0-Abdal-4iProto-Server"
}
```




#### `users.json`

```json

[
  {
    "username": "ebrasha",
    "password": "152314562152",
    "role": "admin",
    "blocked_domains": [],
    "blocked_ips": [],
    "log": "no",
    "max_sessions": 1,
    "session_ttl_seconds": 300
  },
  {
    "username": "user1",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "user",
    "blocked_domains": [
      "facebook.com",
      "*.facebook.com",
      "twitter.com",
      "*.twitter.com",
      "instagram.com",
      "*.instagram.com"
    ],
    "blocked_ips": [
      "192.168.1.100",
      "10.0.0.*",
      "172.16.*.*"
    ],
    "log": "yes",
    "max_sessions": 2,
    "session_ttl_seconds": 300
  },
  {
    "username": "user2",
    "password": "password456",
    "role": "user",
    "blocked_domains": [
      "youtube.com",
      "*.youtube.com",
      "netflix.com",
      "*.netflix.com"
    ],
    "blocked_ips": [
      "192.168.10.1",
      "10.10.10.10"
    ],
    "log": "yes",
    "max_sessions": 5,
    "session_ttl_seconds": 300
  }
]

```

#### `blocked_ips.json`

```json
{
  "blocked": [
    "192.168.1.12",
    "10.0.0.7"
  ]
}
```

### 2. SSH Key Setup
Place your SSH private key as `id_rsa` in the project directory.

Run the following command in the server's file directory to generate a new key.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f id_rsa
```

### 3. Build and Run
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o abdal-4iproto-server
./abdal-4iproto-server
```



## üîß Configuration Options

### Server Configuration (`server_config.json`)
- `ports`: Array of ports to listen on
- `shell`: Shell command to execute (cmd.exe for Windows, /bin/bash for Linux)
- `max_auth_attempts`: Maximum failed login attempts before IP blocking
- `server_version`: Custom SSH server version string

### Traffic Monitoring
The server automatically tracks:
- Bytes sent/received per session
- Total traffic per user
- Session timestamps
- Real-time bandwidth usage

## üöÄ Usage
 

### Starting the Server
```bash
./abdal-4iproto-server
```

### Connecting via Custom Client
We have developed a dedicated client with GUI support that also supports SOCKS5 server creation. For the best experience, use our custom client:

**Download Client**: [Abdal 4iProto Client](https://github.com/ebrasha/abdal-4iproto-client)

### Alternative: Standard SSH Connection
```bash
ssh -D 1080 username@server_ip -p 22
```

### SOCKS Proxy Usage
After establishing connection with dynamic forwarding:
- Configure applications to use SOCKS proxy on localhost:1080
- All traffic will be tunneled through the secure SSH connection

## üìä Monitoring

### Traffic Statistics
Traffic data is automatically saved to `traffic_username.json` files:
```json
{
  "username": "user1",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "last_bytes_sent": 1024,
  "last_bytes_received": 2048,
  "total_bytes_sent": 1048576,
  "total_bytes_received": 2097152,
  "total_bytes": 3145728,
  "last_timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Log Files
- `invalid_logins.log`: Records failed authentication attempts
- `blocked_ips.json`: Manages blocked IP addresses
- Console output: Real-time connection and traffic logs

## üîí Security Features

### Brute Force Protection
- Automatic IP blocking after configurable failed attempts
- Persistent blocked IP storage
- Detailed attack logging with timestamps

### Attack Monitoring
- Logs failed login attempts with username, password, and IP
- Tracks attack patterns and sources
- Provides comprehensive security analytics
